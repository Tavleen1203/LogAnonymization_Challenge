**Approaches Used**

For this challenge I have used two approaches, firstly I have done a simple non-NLP approach of hiding PIIs to gain intuition on the project, I have simply identified the PIIs, and hidden them by using X symbols.

Next, after gaining sense of the implementation I have moved to the NLP Code, the technique that I used here was text masking. For this, I have created a sensitive_info object, for reference. Then upon iterating over the data, each time a pattern of the object is encountered, the mask_text() function is called and it masks the text based on tag defined in the sensitive_info.
